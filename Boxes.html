				<h3>Lesson One:</h3>
				<h4>Thinking like a programmer</h4>
				<div>
					<ul>
						<li><em>Procedural Thinking:</em> Involves creating perfectly clear instructions for a computer to follow.</li>
						<li><em>Abstract Thinking:</em> Finding similarity, or as programmers would say, generality amongst seemingly different things.</li>
						<li><em>Systems Thinking:</em> Happens when you break a big problem down into smaller parts.</li>
						<li><em>Technological Empathy:</em></li>
						<li><em>Debugging:</em> Systematic process of relentlessley identifying the cause of a computer program that doesn't work.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>"ANYONE CAN LEARN ANYTHING"</h2>
					<p>Anyting can exist on the web, plain text, html documents, music and videos.</p>
					<p>
						<h4>HTML documents contain:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Text, what you see</li>
							<li>Markup, how it looks</li>
							<li>Links</li>
							<li>Images</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>HTML documents are made with:</h4>
						<p>HTML elements, when writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags.</p>

				<h3>Lesson Two:</h3>
				<h4>The Make up of a Webpage:</h4>
				<div>
					<ul>
						<li>HTML: Hypertext Markup Language, markup language used to make webpages</li>
						<li>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets, language use for describing the look and formatting of the document</li>
						<li>DOM: Document Object Model, it provides a structured representation of the document (TREE) and it defines a way that the structure can be accessed from programs so that they can chnage the document structure, style and content.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>All webpages are built with the box model in mind, breaking all the individual elements into boxes, in order to better organize the structure of the page.</p>
					<p>elements that make up the webpage are either inline or block. Examples of inline elements are br, em, img spans. Examples of block elements would be divs, p</p>

		<!-- Start of lesson three notes -->
			<div class="lesson">
				<h3>Lesson Three:</h3>
				<h4>Let's talk CSS:</h4>
				<div>
					<ul>
						<li>Search and Replace: think about CSS as a search and replace tool, identify a class, id or tag of the element you want ot find and then replace with properties, values you want.
						</li>
						<li>Order in CSS matters: define rules in the order you want them applied
							<ol>
								<li>Default style of a browser</li>
								<li>Apply styles through a seperate linked css file- Best method to work with.</li>
								<li>Creating your styles within the HTML document, not regularly used, in practice works with small projects that don't require extensive changes and styling.</li>
								<li>Inline styling within the individual element, not effective or efficient as it will cause repetition which is what programing tries to avoid.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Specifics or specificity matters - "Cascading" means that rules are applied not only to the elements they directly match, but also to all those elements child elements. However; if a child element has multiple, overlapping rules defined for it, the more specific rule takes effect.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>All webpages are built with the box model in mind, breaking all the individual elements into boxes, in order to better organize the structure of the page.</p>
					<h4>Steps of the web programmer:</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Look for natural boxes</li>
						<li>look for repeated styles & semantic elements.</li>
						<li>Write your HTML</li>
						<li>Apply Styles (from the biggest to the smallest - remember specificity</li>
						<li>Tweak and fix as you repeat steps 3 - and 4</li>
					</ol>
					<p>* also test in all major browsers.</p>
